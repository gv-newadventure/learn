Discovery Session Script: Azure AI Vision vs Document Intelligence

"Hey everyone — just a quick explainer to clear up a common confusion around Azure's AI services, especially for those hearing about Azure AI Vision and Document Intelligence for the first time.

Azure AI Vision is essentially Microsoft’s tool for helping machines see and understand the world — specifically, images and videos.

Think of it as:

📸 AI for visual content — recognizing objects, reading text, detecting faces, analyzing video, and even flagging inappropriate content.

Now, Document Intelligence — which some of you may already be using — is actually a specialized branch of Azure AI Vision. Its focus? Documents like forms, invoices, receipts, and IDs.

So while Vision looks at a photo and says:

“This image contains text and a restaurant logo.”

Document Intelligence goes a step further and says:

“Vendor: Pizza Place. Date: Feb 10. Total: $18.75.”

To sum it up:

Vision = general images/videos

Document Intelligence = structured documents

Both are part of Azure AI Services, and they complement each other perfectly depending on your use case — whether you're building solutions for document automation or analyzing real-world visuals.
