Got it — thank you for the clarification.
Here’s the corrected email from your perspective as a CNB contractor, asking your CNB hiring manager (not Procom) for the bill rate CNB pays Procom, so you can negotiate Procom’s cut — without discussing your own pay at all.

Subject: Thank You & Quick Clarification

Hi [Manager’s Name],

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to take a moment to thank you for renewing my contract — I really appreciate the continued trust and the opportunity to keep contributing to the team.

I also wanted to ask a quick clarification that would help me in my discussions with Procom. Since Procom handles my payroll and they mentioned that the bill rate has been updated for the extension, would you be able to share the hourly rate that CNB is currently paying Procom under the renewed contract?

I don’t want to discuss any compensation details here — this information is only to help me understand Procom’s structure so I can have a more accurate conversation with them regarding their margin.

If you’re able to share that, it would be very helpful. Thanks again for all your support and for making this extension possible.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
