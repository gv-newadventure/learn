Here are 2–3 sharp, valuable inputs you can bring to your discovery session on invoice ingestion that will make you sound thoughtful and strategic — even if you're not leading the effort.


---

🧠 1. Push for Modular Black Box Design

> "Can we design the black box so that it supports not just invoices, but other document types in the future — like receipts or purchase orders — with minimal changes?"



Why this helps:

Makes the system more future-proof and reusable

Encourages building with pluggable document type handlers (invoice, receipt, etc.)



---

🧱 2. Validate Edge Cases for Document Quality

> "Should we plan for quality issues like blurry scans, handwritten notes, or multiple invoices in a single file?"



Why this helps:

Surfaces real-world input problems early

Opens up discussion around pre-processing with AI Vision OCR, image enhancement, or manual review fallback



---

🖥️ 3. Suggest Smart UI Features

> "In the UI, should we show confidence scores for extracted fields so users can easily review and correct low-confidence data?"



Why this helps:

Improves trust in the AI extraction

Allows for human-in-the-loop validation

Makes the system more robust and user-friendly

Would you like me to help format these into talking points or a one-pager you can bring to the meeting?


Here are a few more high-value points you can raise during the discovery session — these will make you sound thoughtful about architecture, scalability, and governance:


---

🧩 4. Think About Versioning of Extraction Models

> “Should we plan for model versioning? For example, if we upgrade the invoice model later, how do we ensure older documents can still be reproduced?”



Why this matters:

Ensures auditability (important in finance)

Avoids breaking existing workflows when upgrading models



---

🔐 5. Address Data Security & PII Handling Early

> “Since invoices contain sensitive information, do we need encryption-at-rest, masking rules, or access tiers for different roles?”



Why this matters:

Shows awareness of compliance

Forces early alignment with security teams

Prevents rework later



---

🔁 6. Plan for a Human Review Workflow

> “If the extraction confidence is low, do we need a workflow for humans to review, correct, and approve invoice data?”



Why this matters:

Increases accuracy

Helps training future custom models

Makes AI adoption smoother



---

🧪 7. Suggest a Pilot / MVP with Clear Success Metrics

> “Which KPIs should we track during the MVP? Accuracy, time saved, throughput, manual correction rate?”



Why this matters:

Keeps the project outcome-focused

Helps define what ‘good’ looks like

Makes leadership happy



---

🛠️ 8. Identify Upstream/Downstream Integrations

> “Where will the processed invoice data go? ERP? Finance system? Data lake?”



Why this matters:

Prevents integration surprises later

Helps size the black box APIs correctly



---

🚀 9. Batch vs Real-Time Processing

> “Do we expect invoices uploaded in bulk or one-by-one? Should we support both?”



Why this matters:

Affects architecture

Impacts queueing, storage, and scaling



---

♻️ 10. Retention & Document Lifecycle

> “How long do we keep the raw documents and extracted data? Are we expected to support retrieval later?”



Why this matters:

Important for compliance and storage planning

Impacts cost

If you want, I can turn all of these into a quick talking-sheet for you to bring into the session.
