What is Azure AI Vision?

Azure AI Vision (formerly Computer Vision) is Microsoft’s service that helps computers see and understand images and videos — like how Document Intelligence helps with documents.

Think of it as:

📸 “AI for images and videos,”
while Document Intelligence is
📄 “AI for documents.”

👀 What Azure AI Vision can do

Here’s what AI Vision can actually do for you:

Image recognition

Identify what’s in a picture — e.g., “a dog,” “a car,” “a person riding a bike.”

Text reading (OCR)

Read text from images or photos (e.g., signs, labels, screenshots).

Same OCR (Optical Character Recognition) tech as Document Intelligence uses, but broader — not specific to forms.

Object detection

Detect where things are in an image (e.g., bounding boxes around faces, logos, or items).

Facial recognition (with privacy rules)

Detect and analyze faces (age, emotion, or identity — within policy limits).

Video analysis

Track movement, detect activities, or extract frames with specific objects or people.

Content moderation

Automatically detect nudity, violence, or offensive imagery.

📄 vs 📸 The Key Difference: Document Intelligence vs AI Vision
Feature	Azure AI Document Intelligence	Azure AI Vision
Focus	Structured documents (forms, invoices, IDs, receipts)	General images and videos
Goal	Extract meaningful data (fields, tables, values)	Understand visual content (objects, people, scenes)
Input	PDFs, scanned forms, images of documents	Photos, videos, or any general image
Output	Structured text/data (e.g., “InvoiceNumber: 12345”)	Tags, captions, object locations, or text-in-image
Best for	Automating paperwork, data entry	Image recognition, security, media analytics
🔗 Relationship between the two

They’re both part of Azure AI Services, under the Vision family.
You can think of it like this hierarchy:

Azure AI Services
➜ Azure AI Vision (for seeing the world)
    ↳ Document Intelligence (specialized in reading structured documents)

So technically, Document Intelligence is a specialized branch of Vision, trained to understand the layout and logic of documents rather than just “what’s in the picture.”

💡 Example:

If you upload a photo of a restaurant receipt:

AI Vision might say: “This image contains text and a logo, maybe a restaurant bill.”

Document Intelligence will say: “Vendor: Pizza Place, Date: Feb 10, Total: $18.75, Tax: $2.25.”

Would you like me to make a quick diagram or visual analogy showing how Vision → Document Intelligence fits together in Azure AI’s ecosystem? It makes the relationship crystal clear.
